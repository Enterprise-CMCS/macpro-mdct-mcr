 * The app's main skip nav changes its target, if we are on a report route.
 *
 * Note this this behavior might not actually matter. It seems that when
 * there are multiple SkipNav components on the page, the last one takes
 * priority. And when we are on a report page, there will be a second SkipNav,
 * in the sidebar.
 *
 * So it is possible that the conditional logic for isReportPage could be
 * removed, and the SkipNav below could be inlined directly in App.tsx,
 * with no change to the overall behavior of the application.
